# Week 6 – Gherkin “.feature” Files

This week we created our first two <a href="https://cucumber.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cucumber</a> `.feature` files for our use cases as part of "Behaviour-Driven Development" (short BDD). `.feature` files are human readable test cases that are easy to understand even for non-programmers and business people.

## Our first .feature files
Our first two feature files can be found in our use case definitions.

We have updated our use cases as well.
