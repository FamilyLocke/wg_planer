# Week 6 – Gherkin “.feature” Files

This week we created our first two <a href="https://cucumber.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cucumber</a> `.feature` files for our use cases as part of "Behaviour-Driven Development" (short BDD). `.feature` files are human readable test cases that are easy to understand even for non-programmers and business people.

## Our first .feature files
Our first two feature files can be found in our use case definitions.

 - [Registration](https://github.com/WGPlaner/wg_planer/blob/master/app/src/androidTest/assets/features/register.feature) (or directly as a [PNG](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WGPlaner/wg_planer/master/Documentation/UC/FeatureFiles/feature_file_registration.png))
 - [Add Shopping Items](https://github.com/WGPlaner/wg_planer/blob/master/app/src/androidTest/assets/features/manageShoppingList.feature) (or directly as a [PNG](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WGPlaner/wg_planer/master/Documentation/UC/FeatureFiles/feature_file_add_shopping_list_item.png))

We have updated our use cases as well:

 - [UC Registration](https://github.com/WGPlaner/wg_planer/blob/master/Documentation/UC/UC_Registration.md)
 - [UC Shopping List](https://github.com/WGPlaner/wg_planer/blob/master/Documentation/UC/UC_Shopping_List.md)

## Demo
To show you how cucumber tests run, we prepared a video which you can find [here](https://ameyering.de/wgplaner/WGPlaner_Cucumber.mp4). It shows the IDE "AndroidStudio" and the android emulator running the tests.
