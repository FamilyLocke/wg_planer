# Week 9 â€“ Gantt Chart

This week we created our Gantt chart. 

We use YouTrack which has an integrated Gantt chart report. Our Gantt chart is available here: https://youtrack.ameyering.de/reports/gantt/127-1

One helpful aspect of the Gantt chart is that it displays whether the time for a task was over- or underestimated. Moreover, the dependencies are visualized. But as you can see, with YouTrack it's rather confusing than helpful. We neither found a way to customize the chart so that the issues are sorted by creation time, etc., nor were we able to export the Gantt chart's data.

Because of this, we additionally created a report which visualizes the [cumulative flow](https://youtrack.ameyering.de/reports/cumulativeFlow/140-0) of our issues (grouped by workflow).
(Note that we didn't assign workflows to our issues until "Elab #2")

The cumulative flow shows us in which phase our project is and which workflow currently is our main focus.
