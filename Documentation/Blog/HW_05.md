# Week 5 â€“ Scrumboard and first sprint

This week we started to organize our work with scrum. We decided to use *YouTrack* over *Jira*, because *YouTrack* has better integration with the IDEs that we are using (Android Studio and GoLand). We connect YouTrack with our GitHub Repo so that new commits are linked to corresponding issues if tagged correctly.

Here are the links to our project:

 - [Scrumboard](https://youtrack.ameyering.de/agiles)
 - Our first Sprint called "[Elab #1](https://youtrack.ameyering.de/agiles/90-0/91-14)" and second one called "[Elab #2](https://youtrack.ameyering.de/agiles/90-0/91-20?chart&tab=chart)"
 - [Burndown Diagram of our first sprint](https://youtrack.ameyering.de/agiles/90-0/91-14?chart)

*Note:* There seems to be a bug in YouTrack where even though all issues of the sprint are closed, the difference between the estimation and actual spent time is shown as overdue effort. This is *not* correct and has changed around 01.12.17.
