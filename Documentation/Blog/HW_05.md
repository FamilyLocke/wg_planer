# Week 5 â€“ Scrumboard and first sprint

This week we started to organize our work with scrum. We decided to use *YouTrack* over *Jira*, because *YouTrack* has better integration with the IDEs that we are using (Android Studio and GoLand). We connect YouTrack with our GitHub Repo so that new commits are linked to corresponding issues if tagged correctly.

Here are the links to our project:
